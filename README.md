# Transfer_Learning
This repository contains a Mini Project on Transfer Learning by using Fashion MNIST dataset.
# **Description**
In the first notebook training and testing of Fashion MNIST dataset is carried out by creating a dense neural network using tensorflow and keras, then evaluating the performance on the test data by calculating accuracy and loss.
Then in the second notebook we use the concept of transfer Learning to train and test the data by freezing all the NN layers except the last one to calculate the increased accuracy and loss on the same model.
